# TabCaster
A simple script to locally live stream (mirror) your screen in a Google Chrome tab.


## Motive
I usually only share one Chrome window when I'm in a meeting (or a presentation) and need to share my screen. It's more manageable this way and makes me look more professional by not showing the 57 random tabs and apps I have open in the background. But sometimes, in the middle of the meeting, I need to show something else. But I don’t want to go through the awkward process of stopping screen sharing, starting it again on another window or full-screen, and then switching back, all without anyone noticing how stressed I am while searching for what to share, or how hard I'm trying to hide my messy desktop from them.

So, I thought of a better way: What if I kept the other window or full-screen stream running in one of the tabs? Then, whenever I need it, I could just switch to that tab in the Chrome window I’m already sharing. Wouldn't that save me a couple of steps—and a lot of awkwardness? That’s why I made this script.

## How to use it
- Simply open TabCaster.html file with Chrome (or just double-click on it if Chrome is your default browser) and the streaming page will show up in a new tab.
- Click "Start streaming" and the screen sharing pop-up window will appear for you to choose what to stream.

## Any ideas?
Please feel free to suggest any changes or improvements. I would like to see what you have in mind.

## Desclaimer
I would be lying if I said that I made this script myself. It was the result of a long conversation between me and ChatGPT (specifically the version on phind.com)
